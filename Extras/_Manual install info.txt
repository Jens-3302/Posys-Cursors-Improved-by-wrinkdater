Thank you for downloading my carefully designed cursors!

To use any of these cursors, copy this folder to the windows/cursors directory, and locate the cursor you want in the cursor preferences.

(If a cursor is not located in the windows/cursors directory, the cursor will reset after the next reboot of Windows.)

Enjoy!
