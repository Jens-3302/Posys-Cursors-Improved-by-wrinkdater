The cursors and installers are backwards compatible all the way from Win10 to WinXP! Not tested on Win11 so use at your own risk!

The source cursors were created by the wonderful Michiel de Boer aka Posy: http://www.michieldb.nl/other/cursors/

The main idea of the edited version of the cursor pack is getting rid of redundancy, making cursors seamless, lightweight and fast by removing the arrow's tail and make color of pointers match perfectly.

info and instructions.txt:

To easily install the cursors in Windows 10 and below, do the following:

0. Agree to these terms: I am not responsible if anything happens to software or hardware.
You can always manually install the cursors, or check the installer yourself by opening it in Notepad.

1. Drag the folders out of the Zip file.

2. Open a folder ("Posy's Cursor Black" for example)

3. Right click the "_Install" file, and choose "install" in the menu. Discard any warning messages if they appear.

4a. Go to the cursor options.
(In Windows 10, search for "Themes" (in your language) and open themes. Then click the "Mouse Cursor" button.)

4b. In the Mouse options, go to the "Pointers" tab.

4c.  Use the drop down menu to select the cursor theme and click OK. Agree with a message if it appears.

Enjoy!
