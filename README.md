NOTE: I am not responsible if anything happens to software or hardware.

The cursors and installers are backwards compatible all the way from WinXP to Win11!

The source cursors were created by Michiel de Boer aka Posy: http://www.michieldb.nl/other/cursors/

info and instructions.txt:

To easily install the cursors in Windows 11 and below, do the following:

0. Agree to these terms: I am not responsible if anything happens to software or hardware.
You can always manually install the cursors, or check the installer yourself by opening it in Notepad.

1. Drag the containing folder out of the Zip file.

2. Open the folder.

3. Right click the "_install" file, and choose "install" in the menu. Discard any warning messages if they appear.

4. Use the drop down menu to select the cursor theme and click OK. Agree with a message if it appears.

Enjoy!
